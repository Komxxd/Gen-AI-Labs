# 🧠 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) – Image Generation Lab

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this lab is to **implement and train a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate new synthetic images and to **observe how the quality of generated images improves over training epochs**.

In this experiment, we use the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset and train a GAN from scratch. By the end of training, the model produces entirely new images that resemble real clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and coats.

## 🤖 What is a GAN?

A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is a deep learning framework composed of **two neural networks that compete with each other**:

### 🔹 Generator (G)

* Takes **random noise** as input
* Tries to **generate images that look real**
* Its goal is to *fool* the discriminator

### 🔹 Discriminator (D)

* Takes an image as input
* Predicts whether the image is:

  * **Real** (from the dataset)
  * **Fake** (produced by the generator)

---

### 🎯 The Adversarial Game

GAN training is a **zero-sum game**:

* The **Discriminator** wants to correctly identify real vs fake images
* The **Generator** wants to produce images so realistic that the discriminator classifies them as real

As both networks improve, the generator gradually learns to produce **high-quality, realistic images**.

## 🧩 What’s Happening in the Code?

### 1️⃣ Configuration

We define all key hyperparameters at the top of the code for clarity and easy experimentation.

* **Dataset**: Fashion-MNIST

  * Contains 28×28 grayscale images of clothing items
* **Epochs**: 10
* **Batch Size**: 128
* **Noise Dimension**: 100
* **Learning Rate**: 0.0002
* **Save Interval**: Every 5 epochs

Images are normalized to the range **[-1, 1]**, which matches the output range of the generator’s `Tanh` activation.

---

### 2️⃣ Generator Network

The **Generator** is responsible for creating fake images.

* Input: A random vector of size **100**
* Output: A **28×28 image (784 values)**

How it works:

1. Starts with random noise
2. Gradually expands the vector through fully connected layers
3. Outputs 784 values
4. Reshapes them into a 28×28 image

🔑 **Important Insight**
The generator **never sees real images**.
It only receives feedback from the discriminator in the form of gradients saying *“this looked fake”*.

---

### 3️⃣ Discriminator Network

The **Discriminator** acts as a binary classifier.

* Input: An image (real or fake)
* Output: A single probability

  * `1` → Real image
  * `0` → Fake image

It is trained using:

* Real images from the dataset
* Fake images generated by the generator

Unlike the generator, the discriminator **does see real data directly**.

---

### 4️⃣ Loss Function

We use **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE)**.

Why BCE?

* The discriminator performs **binary classification** (real vs fake)
* The generator is trained to **maximize the discriminator’s error**

This loss function allows both networks to improve through adversarial feedback.

---

### 5️⃣ Training Loop

Each training iteration consists of **two main steps**:

#### 🔁 Step A: Train the Discriminator

* Show real images → label them as real
* Show fake images → label them as fake
* Update discriminator weights to improve accuracy

#### 🔁 Step B: Train the Generator

* Generate fake images
* Label them as **real**
* Update generator weights so it better fools the discriminator

This alternating process is what allows the GAN to learn.

---

### 6️⃣ Output and Results

During training:

* Image grids (5×5) are saved every few epochs in `generated_samples/`
* These grids show how image quality evolves over time

After training:

* **100 final images** are saved in `final_generated_images/`

📈 **Observation**
Compare:

* `img_000.png` (early generation)
* `img_099.png` (later generation)

You will notice that:

* Early images look noisy and unclear
* Later images show clearer shapes and structure

This demonstrates that the generator **improved its understanding of the data distribution**.
